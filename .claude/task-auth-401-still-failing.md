# STUCK: Login Still Failing with 401 Error

## Problem
The login functionality is still failing with a 401 Unauthorized error on `/api/auth/me`, despite the previous fix that was supposed to save the token to Zustand store before calling `getCurrentUser()`.

## Test Results
```
====================================
   ❌ LOGIN TEST FAILED
====================================
✗ Did not redirect to dashboard
✗ Token not stored
✗ 401 errors detected
====================================

401 Errors detected:
  - http://localhost:8000/api/auth/me
```

## Evidence
- Screenshot shows error toast: "2 issues" notification
- User stayed on login page (no redirect)
- No token in sessionStorage or localStorage
- Console errors: "Response error: 401", "Login failed 401"

## Previous Fix Attempt
Modified `app/login/page.tsx` to:
1. Call `authService.login()` to get token
2. Save token to Zustand store with `login(data.access_token, tempUser)`
3. Then call `authService.getCurrentUser()` (expecting interceptor to add token)
4. Update store with actual user data

## Why It's Still Failing
The fix assumed that saving to Zustand store would make the token available to the axios interceptor, but the 401 error suggests:
- Either the token isn't being saved correctly
- Or the axios interceptor isn't reading from Zustand store
- Or there's a timing issue between store update and API call

## Files Involved
- `frontend-nextjs/app/login/page.tsx` (login logic)
- `frontend-nextjs/lib/api.ts` (axios interceptor)
- `frontend-nextjs/stores/auth-store.ts` (Zustand store)
- `frontend-nextjs/lib/api/auth.ts` (authService)

## Screenshots
- `login-step1-initial.png` - Login page loaded correctly
- `login-step2-filled.png` - Credentials entered
- `login-step3-after-submit.png` - Error toast showing, still on login page

## Question for Human
The previous fix didn't work. What should be the next approach?
1. Check if axios interceptor is actually reading from Zustand store?
2. Add manual token to API call instead of relying on interceptor?
3. Review the entire auth flow and token management strategy?
4. Check if there's a race condition between store update and API call?

**Need human guidance on how to proceed.**
