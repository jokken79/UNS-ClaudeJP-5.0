## Critical Performance Issue

### Problem: Extreme Next.js Compilation Times

**Observed Behavior:**
- CPU Usage: 149% (constantly high)
- Memory: 1.1 GiB / 7.6 GiB
- Compilation Times:
  - Login: 153 seconds
  - Dashboard: 194 seconds
  - Favicon: 193 seconds

**Evidence from Logs:**
```
Compiled /login in 151.1s (2356 modules)
GET /login [200] in 153260ms
GET /dashboard [200] in 194427ms
```

**Impact:**
- First page load takes 2-3 minutes
- Playwright tests timeout
- Development experience severely impacted

**Recommendations:**
1. IMMEDIATE: Build production bundle (npm run build)
2. SHORT-TERM: Review Next.js config for optimization
3. LONG-TERM: Implement code splitting and caching
