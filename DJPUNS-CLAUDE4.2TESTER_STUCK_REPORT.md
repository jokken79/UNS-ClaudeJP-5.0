# TESTER Agent - Stuck Report

## Date: 2025-10-26

## Problem Summary
The TESTER agent was asked to perform comprehensive visual testing of the 21-font system implementation using Playwright MCP, but Playwright MCP tools are NOT available in the current environment.

## What I Was Asked To Do
Perform comprehensive visual testing with 17 detailed test scenarios:
1. Navigate to frontend and verify homepage
2. Login to dashboard
3. Access Custom Theme Builder
4. Test Font Selector Component (21 fonts)
5. Test Font Preview
6. Test Theme Application
7. Test Font Switching
8. Test Preview Mode
9. Verify Font Categories
10. Save and Verify Persistence
11. Test Multiple Fonts
12. Dark Mode Testing
13. Verify All 13 Themes Have Fonts
14. Export/Import Test
15. Accessibility Check
16. Performance Check
17. Final Comprehensive Screenshot

## Current Situation
- Frontend is running: http://localhost:3000 ✅
- Frontend compiled successfully ✅
- Playwright MCP tools NOT available in environment ❌
- Playwright NOT installed in project devDependencies ❌

## Available Tools
I have access to:
- Read (file reading)
- Bash (terminal commands)

I do NOT have access to:
- Playwright MCP tools for browser automation
- Screenshot capture tools
- Visual verification tools

## Options to Consider

### Option 1: Install Playwright and Write Test Scripts
```bash
cd frontend-nextjs
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install
# Write test scripts manually
```
**Pros**: Full Playwright functionality
**Cons**: Time-consuming, need to write all test scripts

### Option 2: Manual Testing with Screenshots
Use browser DevTools and manual verification
**Pros**: Can verify visually
**Cons**: Not automated, can't provide programmatic evidence

### Option 3: Use Curl/API Testing
Test backend endpoints only
**Pros**: Can verify data layer
**Cons**: Doesn't test visual UI, misses the point of visual testing

### Option 4: Request Human to Set Up Playwright MCP
Ask human to configure Playwright MCP server so I can use it as intended
**Pros**: Matches agent design, reusable for future tests
**Cons**: Requires human intervention

## Recommendation
I recommend **Option 4**: Request human guidance on setting up Playwright MCP or an alternative visual testing approach that aligns with the TESTER agent's intended workflow.

The TESTER agent is designed to use Playwright MCP for visual verification, but the infrastructure isn't available yet.

## Questions for Human
1. Should I install Playwright locally and write test scripts?
2. Is there a Playwright MCP server I should connect to?
3. Should I perform manual testing and document findings?
4. Is there an alternative visual testing tool you prefer?

## What I Can Do Right Now
Without visual testing tools, I CAN:
- ✅ Read the font selector component code
- ✅ Verify font files are present
- ✅ Check theme configuration files
- ✅ Verify font imports in CSS/Tailwind
- ✅ Check console for errors (via logs)
- ✅ Test API endpoints if they exist

But I CANNOT:
- ❌ Take screenshots of the UI
- ❌ Verify fonts render correctly
- ❌ Test interactive elements (clicks, dropdowns)
- ❌ Verify visual layout
- ❌ Test dark mode visually
- ❌ Capture network requests for font loading
